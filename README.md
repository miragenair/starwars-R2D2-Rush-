# Starwars-R2D2-Rush
This is a star wars game in which you play as the adorable droid R2D2 and dodge the enemies and their attacks while collecting the data chips that contains the plans to destroy the deathstar!

### How I made this game
- The game is made entirely using Icons and images which are embedded in the game using the pygame library.
- For the icons I've used figma to edit and customise icons to remove their background and other unnecessary things.
- Each object in the game has its own respective x and y coordinates which are dynamic.
- For movement of the main character “R2D2” I’ve used the keydown functions of the pygame library.
- Used functions and nested loops in order to make the code less redundant.
- For collisions between two objects in the game I’ve used the distance formula of maths.
- Maintained a separate file to keep track of the high score and connected it to the main game python program in order to keep the high score updated after every game.

### Technology Used
- Language used : Python
- Libraries used : Pygame, Math, Random, etc.
- IDE used : PyCharm

### Rules of the game
- In this game you need to collect death-star plans which will gain you 3 points.
- If you collide with a Tie-Figheter jet you'll lose your health by 1, and crashing it 3 times will explode you and the game will be over. 
- However if you do collide with the Tie-fighter jet you can regain your health by collecting the deathstar plans and it will increase your health by 1.
- You have to avoid contact with the laser. if you collide with the laser the game will be over.

### How to start the game
- Download the entire repo on your PC.
- Open the "dist" folder and open on the file named "Starwars.py" and enjoy the game.

Thank you :)
